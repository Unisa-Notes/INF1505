		\section{Computer Waste and Mistakes}
			\begin{definition}{Computer Waste}
				The inappropriate use of computer technology and resources.

				Includes employees wasting computer resources and time by playing games and surfing the web, sending unnecessary email, printing documents and other materials that is then not read, developing systems that are then not used to their full extent, and discarding old hardware that could be recycled. Junk email (\concept{spam}) is wasteful.

				Waste is caused by the improper management of information systems and resources.
			\end{definition}
			\begin{definition}{Computer-Related Mistakes}
				Errors, failures, and other computer problems that make computer output incorrect, or not useful, caused mostly by human error.

				Can be caused by unclear expectations and a lack of feedback.

					\item Implement policies and procedures
					\item Monitor policies and procedures
					\item Review policies and procedures
				\end{enumerate}
				\subsubsection{Establishing Policies and Procedures}
					\begin{sidenote}{Preventing Waste}
						Establish policies and procedures regarding efficient acquisition, use, and disposal of systems and devices.

						Stringent policies on acquisition of computer systems and equipment, including a formal justification statement, the definition of standard computing platforms, and the use of preferred vendors for all acquisitions.
					\end{sidenote}
					\begin{sidenote}{Preventing Error}
						\begin{itemize}[nosep]
							\item Training programs for individuals and workgroups.
							\item Manuals and documents on how computer systems are to be maintained and used.
							\item Needing approvals for certain systems and applications before they are implemented and used, to ensure compatibility and cost-effectiveness
							\item A requirement that documentation and descriptions of certain applications be submitted to a central office.
						\end{itemize}
					\end{sidenote}
				\subsubsection{Implementing Policies and Procedures}
					Varies according to the type of business. Typically focus on the implementation of source data automation, the use of data editing to ensure accuracy and completeness, and the assignment of responsibility for data accuracy within each information system.
				\subsubsection{Monitoring Policies and Procedures}
					Monitor routine practices, and take corrective action if necessary. Can be done using internal audits to measure actual results against established goals.
				\subsubsection{Reviewing Policies and Procedures}
					Determine whether the existing policies and procedures are adequate. Should allow companies to take a proactive approach.
