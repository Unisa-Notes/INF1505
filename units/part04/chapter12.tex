		\section{Systems Design}
			\begin{definition}{Systems Design}
				A stage of systems development where a solution to the problem is planned out and documented.

				The primary result of the systems design phase is a technical design that details system inputs and the processing required to produce outputs.

				\begin{indentparagraph}
					\begin{description}
						\item[Logical Design] A description of the functional requirements of a system. Involves planning the purpose of each system element, independent of hardware and software considerations.
						\item[Physical Design] The specification of the characteristics of the system components needed to put the logical design into action.
					\end{description}
				\end{indentparagraph}
			\end{definition}
			\begin{sidenote}{Notations that can be used to document the design stage}
				\begin{multicols}{2}
					\begin{itemize}[nosep]
						\item Data-flow diagrams
						\item Class diagrams
						\item Sequence diagrams
					\end{itemize}
				\end{multicols}
			\end{sidenote}
			\subsection{Interface Design and Controls}
				How users access and interact with the system should be considered in both logical and physical design.
				\begin{definition}{Menu-Driven System}
					A system in which users simply pick what they want to do from a list of alternatives.
				\end{definition}
				\begin{definition}{Command Line Interface}
					An interface where the user types text commands to the computer.
				\end{definition}
				\begin{sidenote}{Interface Considerations}
					\begin{multicols}{2}
						\begin{itemize}[nosep]

				\begin{sidenote}{Elements of Good Interactive Design}
					\begin{tblr}{colspec={>{\raggedright}l>{\raggedright}X[3]}, row{1}={font=\bfseries}, row{even}={white}}
						Element & Description\\
						\midrule
						Clarity & The computer system should ask for information using easily understood language. Whenever possible, the users themselves should select the words and phrases used for dialogue with the computer system.\\
						Response time & Ideally, responses from the computer system should approximate a normal response time from a human being carrying on the same sort of dialogue.\\
						Consistency & The system should use the same commands, phrases, words, and function keys for all applications.\\
						Format & The system should use an attractive format and layout for all screens. The use of colour, highlighting, and the position of information on the screen should be considered carefully, and applied consistently.\\
						Jargon & All dialogue should be written in easy-to-understand terms. Avoid jargon known only to IS specialists.\\
						Respect & All dialogue should be developed professionally and with respect. Dialogue should not talk down or insult the user.
					\end{tblr}
